## about
[project euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- i'm working through the problems at a leisurely pace.  although i love learning and mathy challenges like these problems I don't often get a chance to solve similar ones in my career.  
- my goal is to solve each problem quickly and move on to the next.  there are plenty of opportunities for refactoring which I would surely do if this was code i planned to share or that would be maintained.  alas it is not so i choose to spend my limited time solving new problems rather than refactoring existing solutions.  one exception that i may pursue is to refactor some of the old-school iterative solutions into more elegant functional ones taking advantage of the lambdas added in java 8.
