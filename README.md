## about
[project euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
- i'm working through the problems at a leisurely pace.  although i love learning and mathy challenges like these problems I don't often get a chance to solve similar ones in my career.  
- my goal is to solve each problem quickly and move on to the next.  there are plenty of opportunities for refactoring which I would surely do if this was code i planned to share or that would be maintained.  alas it is not so i choose to spend my limited time solving new problems rather than refactoring existing solutions.  one exception that i may pursue is to refactor some of the old-school iterative solutions into more elegant functional ones taking advantage of the lambdas added in java 8.
- the commit history is not accurate.  i often work on these on my work computer and have to jump through some hoops to get the code to github since my employer blocks access to it.  this happens far less frequently than i actually work on problems.
